The Hit Men UK
This project is to update the current website for the band Hitmen UK.
www.thehitmenuk.co.uk 

UX
There’s two groups of people this site is aimed at, those who have seen the band and those who haven’t. 

People who have seen the band, probably after a pub gig. The idea of the site is to give them enough information to be able to book the band for a more specific event such as a wedding or party. 

People who haven’t seen the band. Is to showcase the band, so they know what to expect when they see us live. 
In addition, the site will provide links to our social media so they’re able to follow us on which ever channel they prefer to follow; Facebook Instagram or website.

Please see wireframes in wireframe on the main repository.

Features
Existing Features:
Header Menu
Each page topped with the menu all six pages. 
Footer 
Links to social media 

Home page
The theory of this page, it should give you an idea of the band, the photos, our next gig, and a show-reel video, all without having to click elsewhere on the site. The plan is you can go straight to book,  seeing or following the band in just one click. 

Gigs
This gives you a list of all our upcoming gigs, they are linked to the either the Facebook event, for additional information, if no face book event is yet created, the venue’s own website.  

Videos
A selection of the better videos we have of the band showing us in all our glory. 

Testimonials 
Reviews of gigs we’ve played, these are usually weddings or party’s 50th 60th. I’ve coupled the review with a picture of the actual event.

Testing

For testing I’ve used two sites to test my code. 
CSS -https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator 
HTML - https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
The initial tests produced over 150 erros, 2 CSS and 150 HTML I can report this number is now zero  for both. I’ve attached appendex 1 – Testing to give more information on the types or errors when first tested. 

Once I was sure the website worked, I undertook a testing regime on each page. 
For each page I made sure all menu links took you to where they should. Again, with all pages I made sure all the footer links took to you to where they were supposed to. 
I then looked to each page, making sure each feature worked as intended. 
Once was happy with this; I look to my mobile Hauwei p30 lite and my Samsung T580 tablet and repeated the above. 
Following on from this, asked friends and family to review the site, specifically I asked they review site and to report back any links that didn’t work, or poor layout. I also asked they advise the device they were reviewing the site on, all reviews were on mobiles! 
Of the people I asked 11 come back to me, scores were out of 5, the average is charted below. Not all questions were explicitly answered from 1-5, so I intuited a response if there was something negative I applied 2.5 as the result. 

Please see spreadsheet sitefeedback an excel doc found in readmefile/appendix 2.    
 
Overall things look to be a success, I also included a free text section, the one thing that came most, player profiles, as this will be a live site, It will be useful to implement this.

I’ve taken screen shots of the replies, all via whatsapp, these can be found in folder appendix 2. 

Deployment
I found a very helpful video on YouTube; https://youtu.be/8hrJ4oN1u_8  in just under 8 minutes the deployment worked and the site can be view at:
https://whatnote.github.io/milestoneonehitmenuk/index.html
This site is exactly as the repository code.   
My repository can be viewed here:

Content
I drew a lot of inspiration for the two sites below. Both bands are incredibly successful, given their success I scrutinised their sites looking for the key elements and dropping away as much as I could from our current site to make it more streamlined.

https://dasbrass.co.uk/

Media
www.Icephotography.co.uk – provided the index and about us background image, they also filmed the video linked to the site. 
Other photos are either by me, Daniel Culley, or our bass player Fran Okine. 
Out logo was design by our guitarist John Baton.
