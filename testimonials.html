They compiled a great set list starting with tracks from the 1950's through to the 1980's and were very accommodating about our first dance request (‘Back to the Future’ inspired) Earth Angel and Johnny B. Goode. Thank you very much for playing so fantastically and making it a great night for all our guests!"

A pleasure to work with, reliable, a great bunch of people and incredibly talented musicians - in our opinion, the best band in London. The dance floor was packed from the start and every single guest raved about ‘the band’, they make the party. My only word of advice is wear comfortable shoes as you won’t leave the dance floor!”</td>

Luckily my brother had seen The Hit Men UK at a New Year's party in 2016 and he was very impressed. I met the band at a local gig and hired them on the spot. They are so professional and charming and they were brilliant on the night of my party. Everyone was on the dance floor from the start - people who I had never seen dance before were on their feet and you just could not resist their music. They gave me a comprehensive song list to choose from, featuring old and new songs with lots of Soul which I love.
They made that night the best ever for me and my guests, who made so many wonderful comments about the music. I just didn't want the night to end. I would highly recommend the Hit Men UK to get your party rocking!!!"d</td>
